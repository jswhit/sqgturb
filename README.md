includes Ekman damping, linear thermal relaxation back
to equilibrium jet, and hyperdiffusion.

pv has units of meters per second.
scale by f*theta0/g to convert to temperature.

FFT spectral collocation method with 4th order Runge Kutta
time stepping (dealiasing with 2/3 rule, hyperdiffusion treated implicitly).

Requires numpy (pyfftw, netcdf4-python and matplotlib  highly recommended).

example code to run model and animate the solution in ``sqg_run.py``

To run EnKF data assimilation:
* install with ``python setup.py install``.
* first run ``sqg_run.py`` to generate nature run (for perfect model) or
  ``sqg_run_highres.py`` (for imperfect model).
* then run ``sqg_enkf.py``.
