includes Ekman damping, linear thermal relaxation back
to equilibrium jet, and hyperdiffusion.

pv has units of meters per second.
scale by f*theta0/g to convert to temperature.

FFT spectral collocation method with 4th order Runge Kutta
time stepping (dealiasing with 2/3 rule, hyperdiffusion treated implicitly).
